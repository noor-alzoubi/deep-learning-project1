# deep-learning-project1
This repository contain the code and resources for a research project focused on detecting lung diseases in chest X-ray leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) integrated with Gradient-weighted class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The project aims to developa robust and interpretable model for accurate identification of diverse lung pathologies.
